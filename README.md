# BackTrack

BackTrack is a free tool for companies to protect employees from COVID-19 by quickly discovering who a sick employee met with in the past 14 days.

BackTrack scans through GSuite or Outlook calendars and tells you whom a sick employee may have met with and when. To protect employee privacy, it does not look at the subjects or locations of meetings.

The team at Dojo repurposed an existing app (whose "day job" is enabling us to design better offices) and released it to help companies alert other employees who may be at-risk in order to protect them, their families, and the broader community.

If you are using this script at your company, we would love it if you would let us know. Please send a quick email to BackTrack@dojo.co and let us know how itâ€™s working!


## How to run

Please look in the GSuite directory for code and setup instruction.

Note: Outlook tool is coming ASAP!
